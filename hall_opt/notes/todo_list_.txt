test the main file. 
integrate mcmc and map with main file's setup. 

include the run_all_plots logic

Make the script modular: Separate concerns into distinct functions and ensure reusability.
Parameterize file paths and configurations: Allow flexibility in specifying inputs/outputs.
Improve error handling: Add clear messages and fallback mechanisms.
Add logging: For better tracking of operations.
Refactor constants: Move constants like ion velocity to configuration files or reusable module

Encapsulation: Split the main logic into smaller functions (run_map_workflow, run_mcmc_workflow, generate_plots).
Error Handling: Add proper exception handling in critical steps.
Configuration Management: Retain the use of YAML and pydantic for configuration validation.
Flexibility: Ensure paths and directories are dynamically generated based on the configuration.
Logging: Use logging for better traceability of progress and errors.

simplify simulation config. spt_100 would suffice then update the anomolous based on configuration.
helper function updates
settings.yaml file includes sim config
update map with settings

+unified sim config.
+Renamed Variables:
v1_log → c1_log
v2_log → c2_log
v1 → c1
v2 → c2
+The log_likelihood function updates c1 and c2 in the TwoZoneBohm configuration before running the simulation.
remove interpolation, fix log_likelihood

 map params to the input file (settings.yaml)
    # Perform MAP optimization
    result = minimize(
        neg_log_posterior_with_penalty,
        initial_guess,
        method="Nelder-Mead",
        callback=iteration_callback,
        options={"maxfev": 5000, "fatol": 1e-3, "xatol": 1e-3}
    )

	this section should include the initial guesses as well. 
In the input file there should be a flag that says to run map estimate
The input file should have a directory for the location of the data
The input file should have a set of parameters that are needed for map estimate (optimizer choice, initial point, etc)
Running the map estimate should also plot the standard pictures
A file should also be written with the optimal parameters and any optimization details, in a computer loadable format.
Demonstrate running this workflow.

1/14:
integrate spt_100 with config by removing anything related to the cathode coupling model and plume model.
removing all references to the Cathode component and its related parameters, inputs, outputs, and configuration from the YAML file.
removed:
- name: Cathode
  model: !!python/name:hallmd.models.cathode.cathode_coupling
  vectorized: true
  inputs: ...
  outputs: ...
P_b (background pressure for cathode coupling)
V_vac (coupling voltage in vacuum)
Pstar, P_T (pressure-related parameters specific to cathode coupling
cathode_coupling_voltage: 30  # overwritten by V_cc #cathode coupling voltage
-update the loader..
-update Settings class
-plotting test file create
