test the main file. 
integrate mcmc and map with main file's setup. 

include the run_all_plots logic

Make the script modular: Separate concerns into distinct functions and ensure reusability.
Parameterize file paths and configurations: Allow flexibility in specifying inputs/outputs.
Improve error handling: Add clear messages and fallback mechanisms.
Add logging: For better tracking of operations.
Refactor constants: Move constants like ion velocity to configuration files or reusable module

Encapsulation: Split the main logic into smaller functions (run_map_workflow, run_mcmc_workflow, generate_plots).
Error Handling: Add proper exception handling in critical steps.
Configuration Management: Retain the use of YAML and pydantic for configuration validation.
Flexibility: Ensure paths and directories are dynamically generated based on the configuration.
Logging: Use logging for better traceability of progress and errors.

simplify simulation config. spt_100 would suffice then update the anomolous based on configuration.
