What is the difference between Hessian and Jacobian matrix?
A Hessian matrix consists of the second-order partial derivatives formed from all pairs of variables that the function is dependent on. A Jacobian matrix is also a matrix based on the partial differentiation of the function, but first-order partial derivatives.

# --- Check for statsmodels dependency ---
# It's good to check once when the module is imported
try:
    import statsmodels.tools.numdiff as smnd
    _has_statsmodels = True
    print("[DEBUG] statsmodels library found by math_utils.")
except ImportError:
    _has_statsmodels = False
    print("[WARNING] math_utils: statsmodels not found. Hessian calculation unavailable.")
