weakly goal:  limit the number of iterations for the scipy.optimize.minimize function, specifically for methods like SLSQP which don't primarily use iterations in their convergence criteria but might have an iteration limit option. 

 scipy.optimize.minimize Documentation (Mental Check or Actual Lookup): How does minimize handle iteration limits?

The primary way to pass method-specific parameters is through the options dictionary.

Common option keys include:
maxiter: Maximum number of iterations. (Supported by many methods like Nelder-Mead, BFGS, L-BFGS-B, SLSQP, COBYLA).
maxfev: Maximum number of function evaluations. (Supported by some methods, often related to maxiter).
Tolerances (ftol, gtol, xtol, fatol, xatol depending on method).

The specific keys supported depend on the method chosen (e.g., 'SLSQP', 'Nelder-Mead').


Code and Configuration:

YAML: Has map_settings: max_iter: 100.
Pydantic (MapInputSettings): Defines max_iter: Optional[int] = 100. This field exists.
Pydantic (Settings): Has map_settings: Optional[MapInputSettings] = None. This means the map_settings block from the YAML is loaded into settings.map_settings.
Pydantic (MapConfig): Another configuration block related to MAP, holding defaults or internal settings. It also has max_iter: int = Field(default= 100). #This is confusing - there are two places defining max_iter. Need to clarify which one takes precedence or is intended for the minimize call.
run_map_workflow Code:
It correctly loads maxfev, fatol, xatol from settings.map. This settings.map correspond to the MapConfig Pydantic model based on the field names.
It doesn't currently load or use max_iter from either settings.map (MapConfig) or settings.map_settings (MapInputSettings).
Determine Where to Get max_iter:

The YAML provides map_settings: max_iter: 100. This is loaded into settings.map_settings.
The code also has a default max_iter in MapConfig (which populates settings.map).
The user's intent seems to be using the value from the YAML (map_settings block). This suggests settings.map_settings.max_iter is the value they want to use.
Determine How to Pass max_iter:

It needs to go into the options dictionary passed to minimize.
The key should be 'maxiter'.
