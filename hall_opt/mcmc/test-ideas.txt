a) Test the Priors
Run the MCMC without the likelihood (sampling from the prior only). This helps verify:

If the priors are implemented correctly.
Whether the bounds and penalty are functioning as expected. 
b) turn off the validation and penalty for prior/posterior. keep simulation penalty only. track the chain behavior. 
c)gelman_rubin:
Diagnostic metric used to assess the convergence of MCMC chains. It compares the variance within each chain to the variance between multiple chains. If the chains are well-mixed and converged, R^ will approach 1.might be helpful to see what's going on.
