mcmc-results-8(so far):

ISSUE:
Optimized initial guess parameters are invalid! 
{
    "v1": 2.0124301397620146,
    "v2": 2.0028894367014445
} v2 < v1.
-no validation checks implemented for MAP. Prior requirements 
wasn't taken into account during optimization--possibly deviated from an ideal result.
-The initial guess is always rejected in mcmc. Acceptance rate is affected.

ISSUE:
Debugging needed for samplers.py:
/mnt/c/Users/MRover/elsensoy/model_error_uq_plasma/MCMCIterators/samplers.py:279: RuntimeWarning: divide by zero encountered in log
  np.log(1 - min(1, np.exp(accept_reject)))
  
OBSERVATION 
-3.5699  -- 0.12 acceptance rate. 
When set to 1000 iterations, it went down(0.009?)
-the results show some variance compared to the earlier results with larger initial_cov.
-samples remained constant in mid section for about 50 iterations, then a slightly fluctuates. Nothing promising.
but occuring change after the constant period means sampling doesn't necessarily stop prematurely. Sampling continues if conditions are met.
-reasons for the poor sampling --what leads to constant sections for long durations? 

OBSERVATION
-acceptance rate is 0.085 with covariance scaled down to initial_cov = np.array([[0.15, 0], [0, 0.015]])
- compare to covariance set to np.array([[0.2, 0], [0, 0.02]]), for which acceptance rate was 0.11. 
But the sampled parameters for second half of the process showed no variance (0.2,0.02).

TODO:(resolved.)  
(also refer to delta plots)
-ion velocity iteration plot needs revision on legend.(!)

TODO:(resolved.)  
different covariances. possibly track the simulation failures? does all the failures get penalized?.
Compare iteration 1000 vs 200 for different setups.
